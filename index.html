					<h2>Who is Bill gates?</h2>
		            <p>Entrepreneur and businessman Bill Gates and his business partner <span style="color:#c70039;text-decoration: underline;">Paul Allen</span> founded and built the world's largest software business, Microsoft, through technological innovation, keen business strategy and aggressive business tactics. In the process, Gates became one of the richest men in the world. In February 2014, Gates announced that he was stepping down as Microsoft's chairman to focus on charitable work at his foundation, the <span style="color:#c70039;text-decoration: underline;">Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</span></p>

					<h2>Early Life</h2>
						<p>Gates was born<span style="color:#c70039;text-decoration: underline;"> William Henry Gates III on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington.</span>> Gates grew up in an <i>upper-middle-class family </i> with his older sister, Kristianne, and younger sister, Libby. Their father, William H. Gates Sr., was a promising, if somewhat shy, law student when he met his future wife, Mary Maxwell. She was an athletic, outgoing student at the<span style="color:#c70039;text-decoration: underline;"> University of Washington</span>, actively involved in student affairs and leadership.<br>

                       <br>The Gates family atmosphere was warm and close, and all three children were encouraged to be competitive and strive for excellence. Gates showed early signs of competitiveness when he coordinated family<i> athletic games </i>at their summer house on Puget Sound. He also relished in <span style="color:#c70039;">playing board games (Risk was his favorite) and excelled at Monopoly.</span></p>

                    <h2>Bill Gates Education</h2>
                    <p>Gates was a voracious reader as a child, spending many hours poring over reference books such as the encyclopedia. Around the age of 11 or 12, Gates's parents began to have concerns about his behavior. He was doing well in school, but he seemed bored and withdrawn at times, and his parents worried he might become a loner.Though they were strong believers in public education, when Gates turned 13, his parents enrolled him at Seattle's exclusive preparatory Lakeside School. <br>He blossomed in nearly all his subjects, excelling in math and science, but also doing very well in drama and EnglishWhile at Lakeside School, a Seattle computer company offered to provide computer time for the students. The Mother's Club used proceeds from the school's rummage sale to purchase a teletype terminal for students to use. Gates became entranced with what a computer could do and spent much of his free time working on the terminal.<br><br>He wrote a tic-tac-toe program in BASIC computer language that allowed users to play against the computer.Gates graduated from Lakeside in 1973. <span style="color:#c70039;text-decoration: underline;">He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the college SAT test,</span> a feat of intellectual achievement that he boasted about for several years when introducing himself to new people.</p>

                    <h2>Do Bill Gates go to college?</h2>
                    <p>Gates enrolled at <span style="color:#c70039;text-decoration: underline;">Harvard University</span> in the fall of <b>1973,</b> originally thinking of a career in law. Much to his parents' dismay, Gates dropped out of college in 1975 to pursue his business, Microsoft, with partner Allen.Gates spent more of his time in the computer lab than in class. He did not really have a study regimen; he got by on a few hours of sleep, crammed for a test, and passed with a reasonable grade. </p>

                    <img src="images.jpg" alt="allen" class="img img-thumbnail float-left">
                    <p>Gates met <span style="color:#FF5733;text-decoration:none;">Allen,who was two years his senior, in high school at Lakeside School.</span> The pair became fast friends, bonding over their common enthusiasm for computers, even though they were very different people. Allen was more reserved and shy. Gates was feisty and at times combative.Regardless of their differences, Allen and Gates spent much of their free time together working on programs. Occasionally, the two disagreed and would clash over who was right or who should run the computer lab.<br><br> On one occasion, their argument escalated to the point where Allen banned Gates from the computer lab.At one point, Gates and Allen had their school computer privileges revoked for taking advantage of software glitches to obtain free computer time from the company that provided the computers. After their probation, they were allowed back in the computer lab when they offered to debug the program. During this time, Gates developed a payroll program for the computer company the boys had hacked into and a scheduling program for the school.</p>

                    <img src="download (3).jpg" alt="microsoft" class="img img-fluid float-right">
                    <p>In 1975, Gates and Allen formed <span style="color:#FF5733;text-decoration:none;">Micro-Soft, a blend of "micro-computer" and "software" </span>(they dropped the hyphen within a year). The company's first product was BASIC software that ran on the Altair computer.At first, all was not smooth sailing. Although Microsoftâ€™s BASIC software program for the Altair computer netted the company a fee and royalties, it wasn't meeting their overhead. According to Gates' later account, only about 10 percent of the people using BASIC in the Altair computer had actually paid for it.Microsoft's BASIC software was popular with computer hobbyists, who obtained pre-market copies and were reproducing and distributing them for free. At this time, many personal computer enthusiasts were not in it for the money. They felt the ease of reproduction and distribution allowed them to share software with friends and fellow computer enthusiasts. Gates thought differently. He saw the free distribution of software as stealing, especially when it involved software that was created to be sold.</p>

					<h2>IBM partnership</h2>
					<img src="download.png" alt="ibm" class="img float-left">
					<p>IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, approached Microsoft in July 1980 concerning software for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC.IBM first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. IBM's representatives also mentioned that they needed an operating system, and Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely used CP/M operating system.IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, however, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative <span style="color:#FF5733;text-decoration:none;">Jack Sams</span> mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and asked if Microsoft could provide an operating system.<br><br> A few weeks later, Gates and Allen proposed using 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M, that Tim Paterson of <span style="color:#FF5733;text-decoration:none;">Seattle Computer Products (SCP)</span> had made for hardware similar to the PC.[ Microsoft made a deal with SCP to be the exclusive licensing agent of 86-DOS, and later the full owner. <br>Microsoft employed Paterson to adapt the operating system for the PC and delivered it to IBM as PC DOS for a one-time fee of <span style="color:#FF5733;text-decoration:none;">$50,000.</span>Rather than the contract itself, which earned Microsoft a relatively small fee, the prestige brought to Microsoft by IBM's adoption of their operating system was the origin of Microsoft's transformation from a small business to the World's leading software company. Gates had not offered to transfer the copyright on the operating system to IBM because he believed that other personal computer makers would clone IBM's PC hardware.They did, making the IBM-compatible PC, running DOS, a de facto standard. The sales of MS-DOS (the version of DOS sold to customers other than IBM) made Microsoft a major player in the industry.The press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the IBM PC. PC Magazine asked if Gates was "the man behind the machine?".<br><br>Gates oversaw <span style="color:#FF5733;text-decoration:none;">Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981,</span> which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president and chairman of the board, with Paul Allen as vice president and vice chairman. In early 1983, Allen left the company after receiving a Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, effectively ending the formal business partnership between Gates and Allen, which had been strained months prior due to a contentious dispute over Microsoft equity.Later in the decade, Gates repaired his relationship with Allen and together the two donated millions to their childhood school Lakeside.They remained friends until Allen's death in October 2018.</p>

					<h2>Windows</h2>
					<img src="download (2).jpg" alt="windows" class="img img-thumbnail float-right">
					<p>Microsoft launched its<span style="color:#FF5733;text-decoration:none;"> first retail version of Microsoft Windows on November 20, 1985.</span> In August of the following year, the company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences</p>
				</div>
			</div>
					<h2>Leaving Microsoft</h2>
					<img src="images (2).jpg" alt="leave" class="img float-left" style="width: 200px;height: 200px;">
					<p>In 2000, Gates stepped down from the day-to-day operations of Microsoft, turning over the job of CEO to college friend Steve Ballmer, who had been with Microsoft since 1980. Gates positioned himself as chief software architect so he could concentrate on what was for him the more passionate side of the business, though he remained chairman of the board. 

                    <br>In 2006, Gates announced he was transitioning himself from full-time work at Microsoft to devote more quality time to the foundation.<span style="color:#FF5733;text-decoration:none;"> His last full day at Microsoft was June 27, 2008.</span> 

                    <br>In February 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in order to move into a new position as technology adviser. Longtime Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was replaced by 46-year-old Satya Nadella.</p><br><br>

                    <img src="images (1).jpg" alt="corona" class="img float-right">
                    <p>After years of warning that the world was not ready for the next pandemic, Gates saw his ominous words come true with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in 2020. In March,<span style="color:#FF5733;text-decoration:none;"> the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</span> teamed with the Wellcome Trust and Mastercard to pledge $125 million toward efforts to curb the outbreak, and Gates subsequently revealed that his foundation was prepared to invest billions of dollars into building factories earmarked for the development of a vaccine.</p>
